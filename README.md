## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install bedrock-swarm

# With development dependencies
pip install "bedrock-swarm[dev]"

# With documentation dependencies
pip install "bedrock-swarm[docs]"
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a simple example using an agent with the built-in CurrentTimeTool:

```python
from bedrock_swarm.agency import Agency
from bedrock_swarm.agents import BedrockAgent
from bedrock_swarm.tools.time import CurrentTimeTool

# Create a specialist agent
time_agent = BedrockAgent(
    name="time_agent",
    model_id="us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0",
    tools=[CurrentTimeTool()],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant that can tell the current time in different formats and timezones."
)

# Create agency with the specialist
agency = Agency(specialists=[time_agent])

# Process time-related requests
response = agency.process_request("What time is it now?")
print(f"Response: {response}")

response = agency.process_request("What time is it in UTC?")
print(f"Response: {response}")
```

## üéØ Examples

Check out our [examples directory](examples/) for ready-to-use examples:

1. [Agency Example](examples/agency_example.py) - Basic agency setup and usage
2. [Time Example](examples/time_example.py) - Working with time-related tools
3. [Tool Example](examples/tool_example.py) - Creating and using custom tools
4. [Trace Example](examples/trace_example.py) - Event tracing and monitoring

To run the examples:

1. Install with development dependencies:
```bash
pip install "bedrock-swarm[dev]"
```

2. Set up your AWS credentials:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
export AWS_REGION=your-region
```

3. Run an example:
```bash
python examples/time_example.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Built-in Tools

### CurrentTimeTool

A versatile tool for getting the current time and date in various formats and timezones:

```python
from bedrock_swarm.tools.time import CurrentTimeTool

time_tool = CurrentTimeTool()

# Get current time in ISO format
current_time = time_tool.execute()  # Returns: "2024-03-14T15:09:26"

# Get time in specific format
formatted_time = time_tool.execute(
    format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
)  # Returns: "2024-03-14 15:09:26"

# Get time in specific timezone
utc_time = time_tool.execute(
    timezone="UTC",
    format="%H:%M:%S"
)  # Returns: "15:09:26"

# Get formatted date in specific timezone
tokyo_date = time_tool.execute(
    timezone="Asia/Tokyo",
    format="%A, %B %d, %Y"
)  # Returns: "Thursday, March 14, 2024"
```
