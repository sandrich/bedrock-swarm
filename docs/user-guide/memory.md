# Working with Memory

Memory systems allow agents to maintain context and recall information from past interactions.

## Memory Types

Bedrock Swarm supports different types of memory:

### Simple Memory

Basic key-value storage for recent interactions:

```python
agent = Agent(
    memory_config={
        "type": "simple",
        "max_items": 100
    }
)
```

### Vector Store Memory

Advanced memory using embeddings for semantic search:

```python
agent = Agent(
    memory_config={
        "type": "vectorstore",
        "embedding_model": "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1"
    }
)
```

## Memory Operations

### Storing Information

```python
# Automatically stored during conversations
await agent.run("Remember that the project deadline is next Friday")

# Manual storage
await agent.memory.add("The meeting is at 2 PM")
```

### Retrieving Information

```python
# Direct retrieval
last_items = await agent.memory.get_recent(5)

# Semantic search (with vector store memory)
relevant_items = await agent.memory.search(
    "When is the project due?",
    k=3
)
```

### Clearing Memory

```python
# Clear all memory
await agent.memory.clear()

# Clear specific items
await agent.memory.remove("meeting")
```

## Memory Persistence

Configure memory persistence to disk:

```python
agent = Agent(
    memory_config={
        "type": "vectorstore",
        "persistence": {
            "enabled": True,
            "path": "agent_memory.json"
        }
    }
)
```

## Memory Context Window

Control how much context is included in conversations:

```python
agent = Agent(
    memory_config={
        "type": "simple",
        "max_items": 50,
        "context_window": 10  # Include last 10 interactions
    }
)
```

## Best Practices

1. Choose appropriate memory type for your use case
2. Consider memory persistence for long-running applications
3. Monitor memory usage and clean up when necessary
4. Use semantic search for complex information retrieval
5. Implement proper error handling for memory operations
